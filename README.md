# mp3renamer2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.

**mp3renamer2** is an update of my original mp3renamer project which was started in 2004-ish and written in LabWindows/CVI, an ANSI development environment that's... not good. **mp3renamer2** is a complete rewrite in Electron/Angular/Node. Contrary to the name, mp3renamer is not just a file renamer, it's also a pretty solid tagger, metadata retriever, album art/cdart downloader, etc. It does a lot, but generally tailors everything to how I prefer my mp3s to be tagged/organized and usually follows [foobar2k](https://foobar2000.org) conventions. As such, it's probably not all that useful for most other people, although could be useful as a learning experience.
