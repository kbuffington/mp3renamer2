TODO List:

* Detect non-properly title-cased albums (Taylor Swift: Midnights for one)
* Run pingo on .png files downloaded
* Allow text entry for Catalog # in metadata
* clear button for comments
* Show Track Artists value should only be set when loading files or returning from metadata
* Allow saving/handling of embedded .pngs
* Check ALBUMTRANSLATION field having leading space (t√© sample track)
