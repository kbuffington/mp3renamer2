TODO List:

* Remove duplicate Labels, but keep differing Catalog #s
* Don't save original artist field if it's the same as the actual artist
* Show Track Artists value should only be set when loading files or returning from metadata
* Allow saving/handling of embedded .pngs
* Check ALBUMTRANSLATION field having leading space (t√© sample track)
