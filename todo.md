TODO List:

* The "Set Tags" checkbox should only be cleared if data changes
* The "conflict" icon should only show if there are unknown properties -- maybe switch to yellow if ArtistID and RGID is not set?
* When downloaded cover artists, don't let save happen until all requests are completed
* Show Track Artists value should only be set when loading files or returning from metadata
* Allow saving/handling of embedded .pngs
* Check ALBUMTRANSLATION field having leading space (t√© sample track)
